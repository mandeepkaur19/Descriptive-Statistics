# Descriptive-Statistics
Central Tendency &amp; Dispersion: Analyze the dataset's center (mean, median, mode) and variability (range, variance, standard deviation) to understand its spread and typical values. 
Distribution Shape & Summaries: Examine skewness (asymmetry), kurtosis (tailedness), and data summaries like minimum, maximum, quartiles, and interquartile range (IQR) to assess patterns and detect outliers.

Visualization & Applications: Use histograms, boxplots, and scatter plots to visualize data and leverage insights for exploratory analysis or advanced modeling.
